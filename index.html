              <div class="content">
                To open and view the downloaded story, you can use any modern
                video player, if it's a video story, or any program for viewing
                images, if it's a photo story. You can also create a new tab in
                any modern browser and drag the photo / video material to this
                tab, and the browser will automatically open the file in the
                required format. It should be noted that our service provides
                special functionality that allows you to watch Instagram stories
                anonymously by clicking on the appropriate interface elements.

        <p class="bottom-text">
          The first to launch the Stories engine was the Instagram app. A
          version with this functionality was released in August 2016. To date,
          Instagram Stories analogues have launched almost all major social
          networks. Stories are photos and 10-second videos on which the user
          can overlay text in different designs, emoticons or even handwritten
          signatures. An important difference between such posts and regular
          publications is that they are automatically deleted after a day and
          become inaccessible to subscribers.
        </p>

        <p class="bottom-text">
          Today, the considered social network functionality is one of the most
          popular ways of communication, allowing users to exchange photos and
          short videos with their friends. Every time you view a story, the
          users who shared it can see that you have viewed it in their browsing
          statistics. But what if we want to view Instagram story anonymously?
        </p>

        <p class="bottom-text">
          Instagram story viewer is a handy tool that allows you to track the
          content of any user's publications without taking into account
          statistical data. All you have to do is copy the username and search.
          The service will then automatically present the user's profile
          information with the most recently published stories. Click on the one
          you want to watch and watch it anonymously. Your browsing will not be
          counted in the statistics of the social network.
        </p>

        <p class="bottom-text">
          Another advantage of using our service is the ability to watch
          Instagram without registering on a social network, that is, you do not
          need to create an account. You can go to any public profile and easily
          see the latest publications and stories.
        </p>

        <p class="bottom-text">
          In the official application and on the website, there is no way to
          download videos or photos and save them to your device. But there is
          such an opportunity on the Insta-Stories-Viewer website - for this, in
          the pop-up, just click the Download button. And all this is completely
          anonymous! The account user will not be able to figure out the anonym
          in any way.
        </p>

        <p class="bottom-text">
          If a user has active stories, then the function "View repost of
          stories" is available to him in the application, this function is
          provided in order to track the engagement of subscribers. Therefore,
          if you want to watch Instagram incognito, then you should not share
          them.
        </p>
        <p class="bottom-text">
          In addition to the usual stories in the profile header, the user can
          make the so-called "pinned" or highlights. This functionality is also
          widely used. You can add any stories from the archive to albums, where
          they go 24 hours after publication. When placing materials in the
          highlights block, the user must come up with the name of the album.
        </p>
        <p class="bottom-text">
          It is important to note that our service allows you to work only with
          public accounts, private accounts, unfortunately, are not available
          for viewing.
