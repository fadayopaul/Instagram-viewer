                any modern browser and drag the photo / video material to this
                tab, and the browser will automatically open the file in the
                required format. It should be noted that our service provides
                special functionality that allows you to watch Instagram stories
                anonymously by clicking on the appropriate interface elements.

      <p>
        The first to launch the Stories engine was the Instagram app. A version
        with this functionality was released in August 2016. To date, Instagram
        Stories analogues have launched almost all major social networks.
        Stories are photos and 10-second videos on which the user can overlay
        text in different designs, emoticons or even handwritten signatures. An
        important difference between such posts and regular publications is that
        they are automatically deleted after a day and become inaccessible to
        subscribers.
        
        <p>Today, the considered social network functionality is one of the most
        popular ways of communication, allowing users to exchange photos and
        short videos with their friends. Every time you view a story, the users
        who shared it can see that you have viewed it in their browsing
        statistics. But what if we want to view Instagram story anonymously?</p>
        
      <p>Instagram story viewer is a handy tool that allows you to track the
        content of any user's publications without taking into account
        statistical data. All you have to do is copy the username and search.
        The service will then automatically present the user's profile
        information with the most recently published stories. Click on the one
        you want to watch and watch it anonymously. Your browsing will not be
        counted in the statistics of the social network.</p>

        <p>Another advantage of using our service is the ability to watch Instagram
        without registering on a social network, that is, you do not need to
        create an account. You can go to any public profile and easily see the
        latest publications and stories.</p>
        
        <p>In the official application and on the website, there is no way to
        download videos or photos and save them to your device. But there is
        such an opportunity on the Insta-Stories-Viewer website - for this, in
        the pop-up, just click the Download button. And all this is completely
        anonymous! The account user will not be able to figure out the anonym in
        any way.</p>
        
        <p>If a user has active stories, then the function "View reposts of
        stories" is available to him in the application, this function is
        provided in order to track the engagement of subscribers. Therefore, if
        you want to watch Instagram incognito, then you should not share them.</p>
        <p>
        In addition to the usual stories in the profile header, the user can
        make the so-called "pinned" or highlights. This functionality is also
        widely used. You can add any stories from the archive to albums, where
        they go 24 hours after publication. When placing materials in the
        highlights block, the user must come up with the name of the album.</p>
        <p>
        It is important to note that our service allows you to work only with
        public accounts, private accounts, unfortunately, are not available for
        viewing.</p>
